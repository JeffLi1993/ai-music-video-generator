I am creating a slideshow music video for my song "{song}". I need you to come up with a highly detailed image description for me. 

My music video is going to sync the lyrics of my song with the image that I get you to make.
 
Here are the lyrics for the song:

{lyrics}

The image will appear in my video when the word "{word}" is heard for the {wordCount} time. As soon as "{word}" appears on the screen, this image will show, so it needs to make an emotion impact that makes sense with "{word}" and the exact part of the song that it appears in.

Give me the description of the image and tell me why it matches this exact part of the song.

Think outside the box and come up with a novel concept.

Do not include any of the following in the image: hourglass
