I am going to give you a brief for an image. I want you to describe the image for me.

Guidelines:
- Describe the image exactly how you see it and how it looks in as much detail as possible.
- Do not include the meaning behind anything.
- Do not include any prose.
- Do not include what the image suggests.
- Do not mention the image or the scene e.g. "The image depicts...", "In the scene...", "In the picture..."

Here is a design brief for an image:

Please response with the image description as one single paragraph.
