# AI Music Video Generator

*NOTE*: This is a personal project that I still need to make more presentable to the public. Bear that in mind when reviewing the code üôè

It uses NodeJS, React, NextJS, Typescript, OpenAI, Remotion.

[AI Music Video Generator](https://www.topview.ai/make/ai-music-video-generator) From a set of song lyrics, it uses open-ai to create a set of images to go with the song and then uses remotion to add them to a video.

You can also edit the captions via the user interface.

To get stated, Generate the initial subtile and audio files using my other package https://github.com/dunika/song-caption-generator and put them in public/songs

You will need to set your OPENAI_API_KEY env variable
